1. lmod_con: matrix of lmod parameters supplied by user

2. lmod_sig: supplementary signal into the reference input, Vsup

p_j at new steady state can be obtained from global variables lmod_sig 
	The loads at these buses must be declared as non-conforming loads in order for them to be modulated. In this system model they are declared as non-conforming loads, and are 50/50 constant current/constant 
impedance.

3. lmod contains the equations of a load modulation control system for the initialization

4. lmod_st: load modulation state
