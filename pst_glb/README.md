To run the code, you will need to download and install Power System Toolbox http://www.eps.ee.kth.se/personal/vanfretti/pst/Power_System_Toolbox_Webpage/PST.html.
Then, replace pstv3/pst_var.m, pstv3/s_simu.m, pstv3/mtg_sig.m, pstv3/ml_sig.m in PST with the modified files in the attached package (and backup the original files somewhere else in case you need to use them in the future). Put all the other files in the package, and also include PST folders, in your current workspace directory. Then run s_simu.m to start the simulation.
